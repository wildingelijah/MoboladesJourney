## Files

In order to access the files for this project please click "View on GitHub". 

The board.cpp, project.cpp and board.h files contain all our C++ code that runs the game while the .obj files are our chess models that we load into the game through the code. The last file is a makefile that will compile all files together into an executable to run the game.

In order to run the game, download all the files and then navigate to folder in Terminal and enter "make" to compile and link all files into the single game executable. 

It should be noted that all controls and information needed are printed out to the console.
