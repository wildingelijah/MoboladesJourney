# Introduction

This project was designed in its entirety by myself. I coded the scripts for the game using C# while all other aspects of the game were created/developed within Unity. It should be noted that I did use free downloadable assets from the Unity store to help create the environment seen in the game.

## About The Project

The game is a first person single player game. It follows the story of a little boy named Mobolade who wants to become a professional soccer player. The game has 13 levels of increasing difficulty where the player has to use Mobolade to navigate differing obstacles to score on the net. The story is set in Africa hence the worn down environment. I am very proud of how this game turned out as a small scale project for school. I found Unity very easy to use and developing this game was very enjoyable as a learning opportunity.

## Files

In order to access the file for this project please click "View on GitHub". 

The only file necessary is the executable which can be found within the .zip file.

In order to run the game, download the .zip and uncompress it. Then execute the file that comes from the .zip folder. I recommend playing on 2560 x 1600 with low or medium Graphics Quality. This is the only file needed however there are plenty more files that go into making the game such as C# scripts and asset files. If you would like to know more about them please feel free to ask me questions at: **elijahwilding@gmail.com**.
